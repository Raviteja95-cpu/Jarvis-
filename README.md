# Jarvis-
I developed a Jarvis program for this project using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The program's primary function is voice command interaction, including basic greetings like "hey" and "hello" at random intervals. If the program encounters any other queries, it redirects the user directly to Google for further assistance.
